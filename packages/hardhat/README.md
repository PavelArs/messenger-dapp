# Messenger DApp - Smart Contracts

This package contains the smart contracts for the Messenger DApp, a decentralized messaging platform built on Ethereum. The contracts enable users to send messages to any Ethereum address and maintain a history of their communications on-chain.

## Features

- Send messages to any Ethereum address
- Store message history on-chain
- Retrieve sent and received messages
- Track message counts
- Secure and gas-efficient implementation

## Technology Stack

- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity
- **Development Framework**: Hardhat
- **Testing**: Mocha, Chai with Hardhat
- **Deployment**: Hardhat Ignition
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for scripts and tests

## Repository Structure

- `/contracts`: Solidity smart contracts
  - `Messenger.sol`: Main messaging contract
- `/test`: Test files for smart contracts
- `/ignition`: Hardhat Ignition deployment modules
- `/artifacts`: Compiled contract artifacts (generated)
- `/cache`: Hardhat cache (generated)

## Available Scripts

```shell
# Development
npm run compile      # Compile contracts
npm run clean        # Clean the build artifacts
npm run build        # Clean and compile contracts
npm run dev          # Start a local Hardhat node

# Testing
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run coverage     # Generate test coverage report

# Deployment
npm run deploy:local # Deploy to local network using Ignition
npm run deploy:monad # Deploy to Monad testnet using Ignition
```

## Smart Contract Details

The main `Messenger` contract provides the following functions:

- `sendMessage(address receiver, string content)`: Send a message to a recipient
- `getSentMessages()`: Get all messages sent by the user
- `getReceivedMessages()`: Get all messages received by the user
- `getAllMessages()`: Get all messages (sent and received)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start a local Hardhat node:

   ```
   npm run node
   ```

3. Deploy the contracts to the local network (in a separate terminal):

   ```
   npm run deploy:local
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```
   npm run test
   ```

## Deployment

The smart contracts can be deployed to:

- **Local**: For development purposes using Hardhat's local node
- **Monad Testnet**: For testing in a public environment

## Contract Addresses

After deployment, contract addresses can be found in the deployment artifacts generated by Hardhat Ignition.
